# PixelForgeNexus
PixelForge NexusPixelForge Nexus is a secure, full-stack project management application designed for creative studios. It features a robust, role-based backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and a responsive frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS. The system ensures data integrity and secure access through JWT authentication, role-based access control, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).FeaturesThe application supports three distinct user roles with specific permissions:üëë Admin[cite_start]Project Management: Create new projects and mark existing projects as "Completed"[cite: 15, 16].[cite_start]User Management: Register new users (Project Leads, Developers) and assign their roles[cite: 26, 36].[cite_start]Document Management: Upload documents to any project[cite: 22, 26].[cite_start]View Access: View a list of all active projects[cite: 17].üßë‚Äçüíº Project Lead[cite_start]Team Management: Assign developers to the specific projects they lead[cite: 19].[cite_start]Document Management: Upload documents to their assigned projects[cite: 22, 27].[cite_start]View Access: View a list of all active projects[cite: 17].üíª Developer[cite_start]Project Access: View a list of only the projects they are assigned to[cite: 20, 28].[cite_start]Document Access: View and download documents for their assigned projects[cite: 24, 28].üõ°Ô∏è Security Features[cite_start]Secure Authentication: Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs[cite: 30].JWT Session Management: User sessions are managed with secure, short-lived JSON Web Tokens.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A middleware system protects all API endpoints, ensuring users can only perform actions permitted by their role.[cite_start]Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Users can enable Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for an extra layer of security[cite: 31, 44].Secure File Uploads: A secure file handling system stores documents with randomized names outside the web root.Technology StackBackend: Node.js, Express.jsFrontend: React.js, ViteDatabase: MongoDB with Mongoose ODMAuthentication: JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken), bcryptjsMFA: speakeasy, qrcodeFile Handling: multerStyling: Tailwind CSSSetup and InstallationTo run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend and frontend servers.Backend SetupNavigate to the Backend directory:cd Backend
Install dependencies:npm install
Create a .env file in the Backend root directory and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder with your MongoDB connection string.MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas or Local Connection String>
PORT=5001
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key
Run the backend server:node server.js
The API will be running at http://localhost:5001.Frontend SetupNavigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend
Install dependencies:npm install
Run the frontend development server:npm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or another port specified by Vite).API Usage & Testing (Postman)The backend API can be tested using an API client like Postman.Initial SetupBefore you can register users, you must manually add the three roles to your MongoDB roles collection:[
    { "name": "Admin" },
    { "name": "Project Lead" },
    { "name": "Developer" }
]
Authentication FlowRegister Users (Admin Only):POST /api/auth/registerRequires an Admin's JWT in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.Body: { "username": "...", "email": "...", "password": "...", "roleName": "..." }Login:POST /api/auth/loginBody: { "username": "...", "password": "..." }Returns a JWT token. If MFA is enabled, it returns { "mfaRequired": true, "userId": "..." }.MFA Login Verification (if required):POST /api/auth/verify-loginBody: { "userId": "...", "token": "..." }Returns the final JWT token.All protected endpoints require the JWT to be sent in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
